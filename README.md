# ðŸ“Š Real-Time Stock Market Prediction

This project is a real-time stock price prediction tool built using **Machine Learning (XGBoost)** and **yfinance**. It fetches historical stock data, trains a regression model, and predicts **future closing prices** for top stocks like **Apple, Google, Tesla, Amazon**, and more (**25 tickers in total**).


## Features

- âœ… Real-time stock data fetching using `yfinance`  
- ðŸ“… Time-series lag feature engineering  
- ðŸ¤– Model training using `XGBoost Regressor`  
- ðŸ“ˆ Forecasts future prices (30+ days)  
- ðŸ“Š Performance metrics: **MSE**, **RÂ² Score**  
- ðŸ“‰ Interactive plots: Actual vs Predicted + Future forecast  
- ðŸ§  Predict multiple stocks by user input (e.g., `AAPL`, `MSFT`, etc.)


## Tech Stack

- Python  
- yfinance  
- XGBoost  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib  
- pandas, numpy


## ðŸš€ After executing

You'll be prompted to enter one or more stock tickers (e.g., AAPL,MSFT) and the number of days to forecast (minimum 30).
